### General Information

This is the main repository for the user stories challenge.

Visit https://aback-ship.surge.sh/ to see the actual project live.

Visit https://perpation-user-story.surge.sh/ to see the prepartion for the project.

Where I am taking into account all the needs of the client's user stories, do visit [preparation site](https://perpation-user-story.surge.sh/) above.



In the [./src](https://github.com/CustomHaven/user-story/tree/master/src) folder do we have the actual code for the main project. 


### Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Jest
- puppeteer
- Babel

### Mission
---

Make a user validation form. Make it working and have test running for it to eliminate all side effects. Must be responsive to all screen sizes. Credit Card Number input field must have LUHN Algorithm checking for CC type if valid.

### HTML5 & CSS3
---

These two tech is very important as one is the body and the other is clothes of that the body wears and looks good in. So what I mean is HTML5 is the structure of the page while CSS3 is the styling.

Used CSS3 to set up the layout off the page so it is very responsive now.

[CSS3](https://github.com/CustomHaven/user-story/blob/master/src/main.css)


### JavaScript
---

Without JavaScript I wouldn't have made the validation. As this is the front-end technology that is used with HTML5 to make the page structure interactive. Created the functions which made up for the majority of the project here.

[JavaScript](https://github.com/CustomHaven/user-story/blob/master/src/index.js)

### Jest
---

I tested my work ran 33 tests for all the functions all 33 tests came out as passed, and with intended values. I tested the functionality of the project to see how it is working with this tech. We tested the functions for all use cases in both fail cases pass cases. And we have satisfying results.

### Webpack & Babel
---

Webpack is the compiler. As Jest is a node_module package. And uses a lot CommonJS syntax like ``require and module.exports`` which is not allowed to be used for on frontend JavaScript. As ``require`` can be used to find a file from your local files. And Jest needs to see the file it wants to test. Example the javascript file that needs to be tested is named index.js then as I try export it wont work because frontend JS does not understand export property. So with Webpack we can compile it so that Jest will be able to see into the file it needs to test.

As for Babel enables us to use import and export which are the newer JavaScript syntax that a node environment is not familiar with. So with Babel we can make node understand and work with ECMA6 syntax. While converting all ECMA6 to CommonJS for both browser and node to understand.


### Status
---

**Project completed** Form placed in the center of the page and responsive [visit to confirm](https://aback-ship.surge.sh/). All input fields working as to the specification.
